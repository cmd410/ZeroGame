# InterpolatedCamera3D add-on

This addons is a backport of [InterpolatedCamera3D](https://github.com/godot-extended-libraries/godot-interpolated-camera3d)
for Godot 3.x, for easier porting project to godot 4.0 as this addon can simply be swapped to its 4.0 version
due it being fully compatible API-wise. Use this instead of deprecated built-in InterpolatedCamera node.
